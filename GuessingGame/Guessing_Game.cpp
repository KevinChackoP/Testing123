/*
  THE 3 RULES FOR C++ CLASS:
  1. No global variables! (Though Global constants are ok).
  2. Never use strings! (Use cstrings or character arrays instead, and the cstring and cctype libraries are ok. Its recommended that you use strcmp and strlen in your projects).
  3. You should include <iostream>, not stdio. Also, use "new" and "delete" instead of "malloc" and "free".

  Also as for a few recommendations:
  1. Avoid using the mouse when possible. Learn the shortcuts. If you ever work through a shell, you won't have a mouse available to you.
  2. Only use break/continue if you have to, like in switch statements. Otherwise don't use them.
