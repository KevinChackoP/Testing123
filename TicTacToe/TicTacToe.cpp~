/* 
   This project creates an app within the user's terminal that can check their 
   inputted text (up to 80 characters in size) to see if it is a palindrome. 
   It starts by telling the user the instructions for this app, then it will 
   prompt the user for a text input. After the user inputs their text the 
   program will filter out all non-alphanumeric characters from the user's 
   input and puts all the letters to the same casing so that these things 
   can't interfere with the program's check. Then it reverses the input in 
   another cstring to check against the non-reversed and cleaned input. In 
   between these two actions, the program will also report their results to 
   the user so they can cross check the result themselves. If the two cstrings 
   are the same the input will be declared as a palindrome, otherwise the 
   program will say that it isn't a palindrome. Afterwards, the program will 
   ask the user if they'd like to continue using the program, and based on the 
   response it will either close the program or reset everything to be ready 
   for use again.
