  I got help with learning about what a graph is and what Djikstra's
  Algorithm is from the "Advanced Trees and Graphs" canvas module. Among
  these resources was a video made by Mr. Galbraith on graph concepts and
  what graphs are composed of.

  Also in the canvas module was a youtube video made by user Computer Science
  called "Graph Data Structure 4. Dijkstraâ€™s Shortest Path Algorithm".
  URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVfj6mxhdMw
  This video helped walk me through the process of Dijkstra's model and how
  it handles the graph and its data to find the shorted path, something which
  I used for my Find Shortest Path function.

  ADD MORE CITATIONS HERE
